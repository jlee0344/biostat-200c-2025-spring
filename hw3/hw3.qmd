**NOTE: Questions other than Question 3 (using the ELMR book) are attached to the PDF. 

## Q3. ELMR Chapter 5 Exercise 5 (page 100) (70pts)

The dvisits data comes from the Australian Health Survey of 1977–1978 and consist of 5190 single adults where young and old have been oversampled.

(a) Make plots which show the relationship between the response variable, doctorco, and the potential predictors, age and illness.

**Solution ** 

1. Plot for Doctor Visits versus Age: 
The scatter plot with a smoothed LOESS curve illustrates the relationship between age and the number of doctor visits (doctorco). The overall trend indicates a slight positive association, suggesting that as individuals age, the number of doctor visits tends to increase (by slightly). The plot reveals that most data points are concentrated at lower visit counts (primarily 0 and 1), indicating that a significant portion of the sample reports few or no doctor visits, regardless of age. The red smoothed line shows a gradual upward trend, particularly in the higher age range, suggesting that older individuals may utilize healthcare services slightly more frequently. This pattern is consistent with expectations, as age is typically associated with greater health concerns and increased medical needs.

```{r}
ggplot(dvisits, aes(x = age, y = doctorco)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4, color = "darkblue", width = 0.01, height = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red", se = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = "Doctor Visits by Age",
    x = "Age (Normalized or in Proportion)",
    y = "Number of Doctor Visits"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

2. Plot for Doctor Visits by Illness Level: 
We created a boxplot that categorizes individuals based on their illness level (ranging from 0 to 5) and displays the distribution of doctor visits within each category. As the illness level increases, the median number of doctor visits also rises slightly, and the variability in visit frequency becomes more pronounced. Individuals with higher illness levels exhibit a broader range of doctor visit counts, including a few outliers with exceptionally high usage. This pattern supports the hypothesis that illness burden is positively associated with medical service utilization. Specifically, individuals at illness levels 4 and 5 not only have higher median visit counts but also display greater variability, which may indicate more complex or diverse health conditions that require varying degrees of medical attention.

```{r}
ggplot(dvisits, aes(x = factor(illness), y = doctorco)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Doctor Visits by Illness Level",
    x = "Illness Level (0–5)",
    y = "Number of Doctor Visits"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

(b) Combine the predictors chcond1 and chcond2 into a single three-level factor. Make an appropriate plot showing the relationship between this factor and the response. Comment.

**Solution **

We combined the predictors chcond1 and chcond2 into a single three-level factor called chronic_combo. The boxplot below visualizes the distribution of the number of doctor visits across two categories of chronic condition status: "None" and "One", where each category represents whether individuals have no chronic conditions or exactly one (based on the combination of chcond1 and chcond2).

In the "None" group, most individuals with no chronic condition report zero doctor visits. The box is compressed near the zero line, with only a few outliers above zero. This suggests that people without chronic health issues largely avoid visiting a doctor.

In contrast, the "One" group shows a higher median number of doctor visits compared to the "None" group. The interquartile range (the height of the box) is wider, indicating greater variability, and more data points are distributed above the median. Several outliers with relatively high visit counts are also present, suggesting that even individuals with a single chronic condition may require frequent medical attention.

Overall, the boxplot clearly demonstrates a positive association between having a chronic condition and the number of doctor visits. In other words, having at least one chronic condition increases the likelihood of more frequent medical service utilization. This is evident from both the higher central tendency and the broader distribution in the "One" category.

The plot also highlights low healthcare utilization among healthy individuals. The strong clustering at zero visits for the "None" group suggests that healthy individuals may have minimal interaction with healthcare providers, likely limited to preventive checkups or occasional needs.

Lastly, we observe that there are no entries for the "Both" category, which would represent individuals with both chcond1 and chcond2. This indicates that in the current dataset, individuals either do not have any chronic conditions or have exactly one, with no cases of individuals having both.

```{r}
dvisits$chronic_combo <- with(dvisits,
  factor(
    ifelse(chcond1 == 1 & chcond2 == 1, "Both",
           ifelse(chcond1 == 1 | chcond2 == 1, "One", "None")),
    levels = c("None", "One", "Both")
  )
)
```

```{r}
ggplot(dvisits, aes(x = chronic_combo, y = doctorco)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightcoral", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Doctor Visits by Number of Chronic Conditions",
    x = "Chronic Condition Status",
    y = "Number of Doctor Visits"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

(c) Build a Poisson regression model with doctorco as the response and sex, age, agesq, income, levyplus, freepoor, freerepa, illness, actdays, hscore and the three-level condition factor as possible predictor variables. Considering the deviance of this model, does this model fit the data?

**Solution ** 
The Poisson regression model below fitted the doctorco (number of doctor visits) as the response variable and a set of predictors including sex, age, agesq, income, levyplus, freepoor, freerepa, illness, actdays, hscore and the three-level condition factor (chronic_combo) as possible predictor variables. The model summary is showcased below. We assess the model fit using the residual deviance, which represents the goodness of fit test statistic that assess how well the model predicts the observed outcomes in comparison to the performance of the saturated model. The residual deviance is calculated as: 2* log likelihood of the saturated model - 2*log likelihood of the fitted model. The residual deviance of this fitted model comes out to be 4379.7  on 5178  degrees of freedom. The residual deviance (4379.7) is much lower than the null deviance (5634.8). The deviance to degrees of freedom ratio (4379.7/5178 = 0.846) is close to 1 which indicates that the Poisson model's assumption of mean = variance is plausible. The 0.846 ratio is slightly below 1, which suggests possible underdispersion (less variability than expected under the Poisson distribution). However, we can conclude that the model fits reasonably well, as predictors significantly explain variability (large drop in deviance from the null model). In addition, there no indication of severe overdispersion, but slight underdispersion which suggests that the Poisson model may be acceptable. 

```{r}
model_pois <- glm(doctorco ~ sex + age + I(age^2) + income + levyplus + 
                  freepoor + freerepa + illness + actdays + hscore + 
                  chronic_combo,
                  data = dvisits, family = poisson)

```

```{r}
summary(model_pois)
```

(d) Plot the residuals and the fitted values — why are there lines of observations on the plot? Make a QQ plot of the residuals and comment.

**Solution ** 

Residuals versus Fitted Values Plot: 

The plot below displays the deviance residuals plotted against the fitted values (i.e., predicted doctor visits), where horizontal lines of residuals appear at distinct levels. These lines occur because the response variable, doctorco, is discrete count data, and Poisson regression inherently models such data. In this context, each unique count of doctor visits leads to a finite and discrete set of deviance residuals for a given fitted value. Consequently, many observations with the same predicted value produce identical or nearly identical residuals, resulting in visible horizontal bands across the plot.

Additionally, there is a noticeable clustering of negative residuals, particularly associated with an excess of zero doctor visits. This leads to a dense horizontal band near the lower part of the plot, reflecting the high frequency of individuals with no doctor visits in the dataset.

Furthermore, the plot exhibits a slight funnel shape: the spread of residuals is wider for lower fitted values and narrows as the fitted values increase. This pattern suggests non-constant variance (heteroscedasticity), which violates a key assumption of the Poisson model—that the mean equals the variance. This visual evidence indicates potential issues with model fit and suggests that an alternative modeling approach, such as a quasi-Poisson or negative binomial model, may be more appropriate.

```{r}
fitted_vals <- fitted(model_pois)
residuals_dev <- residuals(model_pois, type = "deviance")

plot(fitted_vals, residuals_dev,
     xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Deviance Residuals",
     main = "Residuals vs Fitted Values")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")

```

QQ Plot of Deviance Residuals: 

The QQ plot of deviance residuals compares the distribution of the residuals from the Poisson regression model to a theoretical normal distribution. There is a clear and systematic deviation from the diagonal reference line, especially at the tails, indicating that the residuals do not follow a normal distribution. In the right tail, many residuals rise sharply above the expected quantiles, while in the left tail, several fall well below the line. These deviations suggest asymmetry and heavy tails, both of which are signs of model misfit.

The middle portion of the QQ plot displays a flat, stair-step pattern rather than a smooth progression along the line. This is a result of the discrete nature of the Poisson model, where repeated response values (such as 0s and 1s) lead to residuals that stack at similar quantiles.

The presence of extreme residuals at both ends of the plot further points to outliers and skewness in the data—strong indicators of model misspecification or inadequate fit. Overall, the QQ plot suggests that the Poisson model does not fully capture the variability in the data, potentially violating its core assumption that the mean equals the variance.


```{r}
qqnorm(residuals_dev, main = "QQ Plot of Deviance Residuals")
qqline(residuals_dev, col = "blue")
```


(e) Use a stepwise AIC-based model selection method. What sort of person would be predicted to visit the doctor the most under your selected model?

**Solution ** 
The stepwise AIC-based model selection method was applied to the initial Poisson regression model. The resulting model includes the following predictors: sex, age, income, illness, levyplus, freepoor, actays, hscore, and chronic_combo. The final model has a residual deviance of 4381.3 on 5180 degrees of freedom, with a AIC score of 6732.8. 

The sort of person that would be predicted to visit the doctor the most under the selected model would have the following characterisitics: 
1. Female (the sex coefficient is positive and highly significant): women are predicted to visit the doctor more often than men. In more technical terms, being female is associated with an increase in the log of the expected number of doctor visits by 0.160, compared to being male, holding all other predictors constant.
2. Older (age is positive and significant): Age is positively associated with the log of the expected number of doctor visits, meaning that as age increases, the expected number of visits also increases, holding all other variables constant.
3. Low Income (income has a negative coefficient and slightly significant): Lower income is associated with a higher log of the expected number of doctor visits, holding all other variables constant.
4. Not covered by freepoor program (freepoor is negative and significant): Individuals who are not covered by the government due to low income, recent immigration status, or unemployment (i.e., not enrolled in the freepoor program) are associated with a higher log expected number of doctor visits, compared to those who are covered, holding all other variables constant.
5. High illness score (illness is one of the most strongly signifiant varialbes): More illness episodes are associated with a significant increase in the log of the expected number of doctor visits, holding all other variables constant.
6. Many activity-limited days (actdays is very highly significant and positive): As the number of days with reduced activity in the past two weeks due to illness or injury increases, the log of the expected number of doctor visits also increases.
7. Poor general health (hscore is positively associated): Based on a general health questionnaire score derived from Goldberg's method, individuals with poorer health status are associated with a higher log of the expected number of doctor visits.
8. Has one chronic condition (chornic_comboOne is significant): having at least one chronic condition increases the log of expected number of doctor visits.

model_step <- stepAIC(model_pois, direction = "both")

(f) For the last person in the dataset, compute the predicted probability distribution for their visits to the doctor, i.e., give the probability they visit 0, 1, 2, etc. times.

**Solution ** 

Based on the Poisson regression model, the predicted number of doctor visits for the last person in the dataset is centered around zero visits. The model estimates an 85.91% probability that this person will not visit the doctor at all, followed by a 13.05% chance of making exactly one visit. The probabilities for two or more visits drop off sharply, with only a 0.99% chance of two visits, and even lower probabilities after the number of visits hit 3 visits. This distribution indicates that the individual has a very low expected rate of doctor visits. The highly right-skewed distribution is typical in Poisson models for count data, especially when the mean count is close to zero.

```{r}
last_person <- dvisits[nrow(dvisits), ]
lambda <- predict(model_step, newdata = last_person, type = "response")

visit_range <- 0:10
probabilities <- dpois(visit_range, lambda)

prob_dist <- data.frame(
  `Number of Visits` = visit_range,
  `Probability` = probabilities
)

kable(prob_dist, digits = 5, caption = "Predicted Probability Distribution for Doctor Visits")

```

(g) Tabulate the frequencies of the number of doctor visits. Compute the expected frequencies of doctor visits under your most recent model. Compare the observed with the expected frequencies and comment on whether it is worth fitting a zero-inflated count model.

**Solution ** 
The code below tabulates the observed frequencies of doctor visits (doctorco) and predicts the expected number of visits for each individual in the dataset using the most recent Poisson regression model, obtained through stepwise AIC-based model selection. It then computes the expected frequency distribution across visit counts (from 0 to the maximum observed) by averaging the Poisson probabilities for each count across all individuals. The resulting comparison table shows that the observed and expected frequencies are closely aligned, particularly for 0 and 2 visits. The largest discrepancy occurs at 1 visit, where the model slightly overestimates (928.36 expected vs. 782 observed). Notably, the number of zero visits is very well predicted by the model (4141 observed vs. 4013.53 expected).

Evaluation of the Need for a Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) Model:
Zero-inflated models are typically applied when the observed number of zeros exceeds the expected count under a standard Poisson model. That is not the case here—the predicted number of zero visits (4013.53) is very close to the observed number (4141), indicating that the Poisson model handles zero inflation adequately. Additionally, the remaining distribution (1, 2, 3 visits) aligns well with model predictions. Given this strong agreement, there is no compelling evidence of excess zeros. Therefore, a standard Poisson model is sufficient, and it is not necessary to fit a zero-inflated count model in this case.


```{r}
observed_freq <- table(dvisits$doctorco)
predicted_lambda <- predict(model_step, type = "response")

visit_range <- 0:max(dvisits$doctorco)
expected_probs <- colMeans(sapply(visit_range, function(k) dpois(k, predicted_lambda)))
expected_freq <- expected_probs * nrow(dvisits)

comparison_df <- data.frame(
  `Number of Visits` = visit_range,
  `Observed Frequency` = as.numeric(observed_freq[as.character(visit_range)]),
  `Expected Frequency` = round(expected_freq, 2)
)

comparison_df$Observed.Frequency[is.na(comparison_df$Observed.Frequency)] <- 0
kable(comparison_df, digits = 2, caption = "Observed vs. Expected Frequencies of Doctor Visits (Poisson Model)")
```


(h) Fit a comparable (Gaussian) linear model and graphically compare the fits. Describe how they differ.

The plot below compares the fitted values from two models—the Poisson regression model (blue points) and the Gaussian (normal/linear) model (red points)—against the observed number of doctor visits. There are several notable differences between the two fits. The Poisson model is specifically designed for count data, such as the number of doctor visits. It ensures non-negative predictions and assumes that the variance is proportional to the mean. In contrast, the Gaussian linear model assumes normally distributed residuals and constant variance, assumptions that are not appropriate for skewed, count-based data.

We observe that the Poisson model produces a wider and more dispersed range of fitted values, particularly for low observed counts. This better reflects the skew and variability often present in real-world count data. The Gaussian model, however, generates smoother, more compressed fitted values that tend to cluster tightly around the mean. It also underestimates higher visit counts and often assigns similar predicted values to very different observations.

The Poisson model more effectively captures the long tail of higher doctor visit counts, whereas the Gaussian model struggles—frequently predicting much lower fitted values for individuals with high observed visits due to its inability to accommodate skewed distributions. Therefore, we conclude that the Poisson model provides a better and more practical fit for this dataset, as it respects the count nature of the response variable and handles skew more appropriately.

```{r}
model_gaussian <- lm(doctorco ~ sex + age + income + levyplus + freepoor +
                     illness + actdays + hscore + chronic_combo,
                     data = dvisits)

fitted_pois <- predict(model_step, type = "response")
fitted_gaus <- predict(model_gaussian)

plot_data <- data.frame(
  Observed = dvisits$doctorco,
  Poisson_Fitted = fitted_pois,
  Gaussian_Fitted = fitted_gaus
)
